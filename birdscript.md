# __**Abstract**__

interpreted programming language that bridges the gap between Python and shell programming, and is thus ideally suited for "throw-away programming" and rapid prototyping. Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences from Python, C and Icon.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented. Bird Script is also suitable as an extension language for customizable Python applications such as editors or GUI projects.

Bird Script is available for various systems, amongst which most common flavors of MICROSOFT WINDOWS (including 8-10), the Apple Mac, Linux.
